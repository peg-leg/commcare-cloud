# 60. Upgrade to Python 3.10

**Date:** 2022-11-07

**Optional per env:** _required on all environments_


## CommCare Version Dependency
This change is not known to be dependent on any particular version of CommCare.


## Change Context
Follow these steps to install and use Python 3.10 on your control machine(s) by December 19th, 2022.

## Details
As part of our ongoing effort to keep CommCare HQ up to date with the latest tools and
libraries we are requiring that commcare-cloud run on Python 3.10. Python 3.6 has reached end of life,
and we are requiring that everyone move to Python 3.10 by December 19th, 2022.

## Steps to update
Follow the steps below to properly install Python 3.10 and its dependencies.
```
$ sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt-get -y install python3.10 python3.10-dev python3.10-distutils python3.10-venv libffi-dev
```
Once Python 3.10 is installed on your control machine, run:
```
$ update-code
```
which will pull the latest version of commcare-cloud and trigger the creation and activation of a Python 3.10 virtual environment.

Confirm the active virtual environment is using Python 3.10
```
$ python --version
```
Finally, run:
```
$ manage-commcare-cloud configure
```
